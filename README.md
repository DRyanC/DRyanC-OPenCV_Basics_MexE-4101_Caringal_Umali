# Basics of OpenCV with Python and Google Colab  

This project is based on learning and implementing the fundamentals of OpenCV, following the tutorial: [OpenCV Basics and Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Lg4aZVCAU).  

## üìù Topics Covered  

### Basics  
- **Drawing and Texts**: Adding shapes and annotations.  
- **Color Profiles**: Understanding color representation.  
- **Edge Detection**: Detecting image boundaries.  
- **Image Manipulation**: Resizing, cropping, and transformations.  

### Intermediate  
- **Face Detection**: Identifying faces with pre-trained models.  
- **Color Detection**: Isolating and highlighting specific colors.  
- **Shape Detection**: Recognizing shapes through contour analysis.  

With the knowledge gathered from this tutorial, we will apply these concepts to create projects such as ball tracking, face recognition, and more. These projects can be highly useful for applications in fields like security systems, real-time monitoring, augmented reality, and automation, providing practical solutions to everyday challenges.
